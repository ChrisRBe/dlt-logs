# dlt-logs README

[![Version](https://vsmarketplacebadge.apphb.com/version/mbehr1.dlt-logs.svg)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mbehr1.dlt-logs)

This Visual Studio Code(tm) extension adds support to open DLT (diagnostic log and trace) (todo see genivi/autosar...) files.

**Note:** It works well with [![Version](https://vsmarketplacebadge.apphb.com/version/mbehr1.smart-log.svg)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mbehr1.smart-log) **smart-log** extension and supports the "time-sync" feature. (todo picture/animation...)

## Features

- Open DLT files without any size restriction.
- **Time sync** feature.
  - Calculates time for each line based on timestamp and reception/storage time.
  - An offset for the full time can be set via context menu item *adjust-time...*.
  - Posts events of the selected time to other documents/plugins. (See ... <todo>).
- Detects the lifecycles and shows them in a tree-view.
- Allows to filter for:
  - ECUID
  - APID
  - CTID
  - ...

> Tip: Many popular extensions utilize animations. This is an excellent way to show off your extension! We recommend short, focused animations that are easy to follow. -->

## Planned features

- Sort msgs within lifecycles by timestamp (maintaining orig index as e.g. hover info)
- Add status bar info with e.g. number of msgs with current filter/total.
- Support easier splitting of huge files into files per lifecycle and offer "assistant" at opening of huge files.
- Support DLT file tranfer file extraction (and automatic filtering of those msgs).
- Support time synchronized split-view between e.g. two APIDs from within one DLT log file.
- Use the outline view for lifecycles, errors,...
- Add support for file changes (growing) and load/update automatically.
