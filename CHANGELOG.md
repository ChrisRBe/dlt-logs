### [1.0.0]
* promoted to v1.0.0 as part of introducing semantic-release versioning. No functional changes.

### [0.30.3]
- restQuery: /docs: allow for ecu=name name to be "" and match empty string for all ECUs.

### [0.30.2]

- restQuery: add lifecycles attribute to filter

### [0.30.0]
- implemented rest query for other extensions and via test command "dlt-logs test rest query" for
/get/version, /get/docs/<id>/ecus and /get/docs/<id>/filters. 
For filters options to add/patch/delete/enable/disable are available. But currently without directly persisting them.
But take care any addition action that will store the filters (e.g. add/change via UI) will persist them!

### [0.29.2]
- Removed some wrong package dependencies that lead to a big install package.

### [0.29.1]

- Ignoring timeStamp jumps > 10mins for lifecycle detection.
- Print lifecycle start time with date.

### [0.26.0]
- Lifecycle detection now doesn't mix lifecycles where the ECU id is coming from storageheader and msg header. Lifecycles with ECU from storageheader are prepended with a \<SH\_\>.

### [0.25.1]
- For export logs: removed assumption to lifecycle only grow to start/end for updating the description.

### [0.25.0]
- Added reportOptions.conversionFunction to map or calclate more complex values or add constants to the reports.

### [0.24.1]
- Added INT_ to report capture name to convert directly with parseInt. This needs to be used e.g. for hex values.

### [0.24.0]
- Improved lifecycle detection (mergeing overlapping LCs from same ecu)

### [0.23.1]
- Updated dependencies (after github security advisory)

### [0.23.0]

### [0.18.0]
- Memory load/usage optimizations.
- Removed binary-parser.
- Format timestamp in secs in hover.

### [0.17.1]

- Improved progress output on loading to better readable values.

### [0.17.0]

### [0.11.0]
- Report-filter are now added by default into the same (last active) view. So you can show multiple filter in same report.
- Added alt/option command to add report-filter into a new report.

### [0.10.0]
- 'Toggle lifecycle start' now considers overlapping lifecycles.
- Added support for "state" reports. Capture name must start with "STATE_". "reportOptions.valueMap" can be added to the filter to map captured values to shown state names.
